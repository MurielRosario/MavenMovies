# MavenMovies

• INTRODUCTION:

I'm the partner and new co-owner of Maven Movies, a DVD rental business. My primary role is being in charge of the day-to-day operations.

• BRIEF:

As a new owner, I need to learn everything I can about the business:
Product inventory, the staff, customer purchase behaviors, etc.
I'll have access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database. With little information about the company from our current employees, I'll have to analyze everything independently.

• THE OBJECTIVE:

Use MySQL to explore and analyze the 19 tables within the "mavenmovies" database. 

• SKILLS:

- Data Analysis
- Relationship Diagrams
- Multi-Table Querying (JOINS)
- Aggregate Functions
- CASE statement
- SELECT statement
